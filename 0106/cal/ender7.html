      Ali Bramwell<BR>
      <BR>
      In this body of work Bramwell used predominantly steel. The industrial character 
      of the metal was softened by the fires of the forge, and altered by chrome 
      electroplating or powder coating. The show also featured a liberal use of 
      barbed wire, which brings an implication of threat into the work. Bramwell 
      believes barbed wire has an already ambiguous character for most New Zealanders... 
      it is used so much on our farms barbed wire recalls quiet farming scenes 
      as well as images of violence.</TD>
	<TD VALIGN="TOP"> The way that Bramwell used it is similarly ambiguous: the 
      possibility of the barbs tearing your skin still repels; but there is also 
      an eerie and alluring sensuality, a strange kind of beauty, in the work 
      that when combined with the sense of ambiguous threat makes the experience 
      of the work overlaid with a surreal or dreamlike quality. This exhibition 
      was concerned with implications of fear and identity politics. Security 
      and comfort are both necessary and potentially dangerous. Fear causes us 
      to contract and reinforce boundaries. Threat causes us to cling to what 
      we know. The hairs on your body raise and prickle, your skin is alive and 
      listening.<BR> </TD>
