      All artists are sensitive to the reactions of the viewer; when a work is 
      mocked publicly the artist can either take it personally, ignore it, or 
      use it in some way. The work 'Noughts, crosses or tiddlywinks..?' was derived 
      from a response to a painting by Paul Johns exhibited previously; a response 
      of humour to capture and entertain the gazing eye of the newspaper reader. 
      The press is only too aware of the cursory glance that most items receive, 
      and it is by their use of sensationalism, shock or <BR>

      humour that will capture the viewers attention. Despite the serious intent 
      of the original art work (a work using the divine proportion, or the golden 
      rectangle, as its main unit) it has been viewed by the press (THE DOMINION) 
      as a giant game of noughts and crosses: or to further emphasise the flippant 
      attitude of the writer it could be a giant game of tiddlywinks.<BR>
      And it could be.<BR>
      But it wasn't.<BR>
      Yes --- it is a painting. </TD>
