      Fox Rox<BR>
      A.D. Schierning<BR> <BR>
      The fashion of the punked up '80s is back in style; perhaps its time the 
      attitude had a revival through art. No more Mr Nice guy, if art were an 
      expression she'd be screaming FUCK YOU!<BR>
      The Fox is the animal pursued simply for sport whose cunning and beauty 
      add to the thrill of the chase. And here is the Valley of the Foxes; here 
      is the fox fighting back and winning. By forming a gang the foxes gained 
      power, by sticking together they were stronger and they never left the pack 
      again. <BR></TD>

      The Valley of the Foxes is a vent to cool from, a way of saying fuck you 
      all, without being arrested or killed. The Fox is a victim, it knows it 
      is, women in general have no idea how inbred conditioning has limited or 
      simply structured their lives. <BR>
      So this is the Fox strikes back. She is basically sick of living out male 
      fantasies, wearing bondage chains in the form of high heels and tight leather 
      minis. This is the Fox telling the whole establishment to fuck off. Nothing 
      will be taken for granted, everything will be questioned and no one will 
      be objectified.</TD>
